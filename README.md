# What
A basic script (for now) to calculate the suggested number of 5L watering cans to apply to your garden per square meter. This calculation is based on precipiation and evapotranspiration observations and predictions from open-meteo.com. 

# Why
This will form the basis of the core library for calculating watering suggestions for the [waterlogged prototype](https://github.com/nseymoursmith/waterlogged-prototype) app.

I am separating it from that repo because it can already be used and developed independently of that app on the commandline: `python waterbalance.py`.

# Next steps
Start to develop this script into a library that can be pulled into the waterlogged app when that is ready.
